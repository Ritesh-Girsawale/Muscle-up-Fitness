1. Project Title:
Muscle Up – An E-commerce Platform for Gym Supplements & Accessories where you can buy proteins and other gym sumpiments and accessories at low price that can be pocket friendly for you


2. Objective:
The goal of this project is to provide a seamless online shopping experience for fitness enthusiasts by offering a variety of protein supplements, gym accessories, and related products.
Additionally, Muscle Up helps consumers buy these products at lower prices compared to physical stores, as it sources items directly from wholesale stock.

This platform also supports individuals who cannot afford a personal trainer by offering:

BMI Calculation: Users can calculate their BMI to track their fitness progress.
Personalized Diet Plans: Guidance on gaining weight and achieving fitness goals.
Weekly Workout Schedules: Structured exercise routines to help users stay on track.
This makes Muscle Up not just an e-commerce store but also a fitness companion for users looking to improve their health affordably.



3. Problem Statement: why i have selected this project 
Many fitness enthusiasts struggle to find genuine and high-quality gym supplements and accessories online. Muscle Up solves this problem by providing a reliable, user-friendly,
 and secure platform with verified products at wholesale prices.

personal trainers, and nutritionists at the same time. Muscle Up addresses this by offering:

Affordable Supplements & Accessories: Products at lower prices than physical stores.
Free Fitness Guidance: Users can access BMI calculators, structured workout plans, and customized diet plans without extra cost.
Free Virtual Training Sessions: Beginners and budget-conscious individuals can benefit from expert-designed weekly workout schedules and fitness guidance at no additional cost.
