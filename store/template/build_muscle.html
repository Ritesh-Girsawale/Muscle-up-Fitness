            <h2><b>Build Muscles</b></h2>
            <hr>

            <h5>What is Muscle Building ?</h5>
            <p>Muscle building refers to the process of increasing muscle size and strength.
                This is primarily achieved through consistent exercise, proper nutrition, and adequate rest.</p>


            <h5>Exercise?</h5>
            <p>Resistance training, such as lifting weights and doing bodyweight exercises like push-ups and squats, is
                essential for muscle growth. These exercises cause small tears in muscle fibres, and as the body repairs
                these tears, muscles become larger
                and stronger. Gradually increasing the weight or resistance, or progressive overload, is key to
                continued muscle development.</p>


            <h5>Nutrition?</h5>
            <p>Nutrition is crucial for muscle gain. Protein is especially important as it supplies amino acids, the
                building blocks for muscle repair and growth. Good protein sources include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy
                products, legumes, and protein supplements.
                Additionally, consuming enough carbohydrates and healthy fats provides the energy needed for intense
                workouts and recovery.</p>


            <h5>Reast and Recovery?</h5>
            <p>Adequate rest is vital because muscles grow during recovery periods, not during the workout itself. This
                means getting enough
                sleep and allowing time between workouts for muscles to repair and grow. <br>
                By combining these elements—regular exercise, proper nutrition, and sufficient rest—you can effectively
                gain muscle and improve overall strength and fitness.</p>


            <h3><b>Tips To Build Muscles</b></h3>

            <p>You can choose from many workouts to build muscle, but these tips will help you integrate muscle-building
                into your activities and regular workouts.</p>

            <p><b>Lift Big, Get Big:</b> There's no shortcut to gains, as you likely know if you're a lifter. Add more
                weight to your routine to build muscle mass quickly, a great start to your muscle-building journey.</p>

            <p><b>Add Compound Exercises:</b> Compound movements target multiple muscle groups and enhance
                muscle protein synthesis. These exercises increase strength, muscle mass, and mobility.</p>


            <p><b>Let Your Muscles Recover:</b>Rest days are crucial for muscle recovery and rebuilding, often
                underrated but essential in muscle building.</p>


            <p><b>Push Yourself:</b>Push your limits; there's no gain without pain. Push until you can't do another rep,
                creating microtears necessary for new muscle development.</p>


            <p><b>Plan Your Meals:</b> Planning meals is vital. While we know a balanced, protein-rich diet is key,
                planning prevents impulsive, unhealthy eating during hunger pangs.</p>


            <p><b>Adopt Protein:</b> Incorporate protein into your diet. A high-protein diet is crucial for muscle
                growth and strength, reducing calorie intake by controlling hunger hormones.

            </p>

            <p><b>Fuel with Supplements: </b> For increased muscle growth, consume more than the recommended dietary
                protein. Choose the right, authentic supplements.</p>
