            <h2><b>Lean Muscle Mass</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <h5>What is Lean Muscle Mass?</h5>
            <p>Lean muscle mass refers to the weight of the muscles in your body, excluding any fat. It plays a crucial
                role in overall health and fitness. Lean muscle mass includes not only the muscles that help with
                movement and lifting but also the muscles in your heart and other organs. Having a higher proportion of
                lean muscle mass is beneficial for several reasons: it enhances strength and mobility, allowing for
                easier execution of everyday tasks like carrying groceries or climbing stairs; it boosts metabolism, as
                muscles burn more calories than fat even at rest, aiding in weight management; it supports better
                overall health by reducing the risk of injuries and conditions like osteoporosis; and it improves energy
                levels, helping you stay active and less fatigued
                throughout the day. Increasing lean muscle mass involves a combination of strength training exercises,
                such as lifting weights or doing push-ups, and proper nutrition, particularly adequate protein intake
                from sources like meat, beans, and nuts, to support muscle growth and repair. In summary, lean muscle
                mass is essential for physical strength, metabolic health, and overall well-being, and maintaining it
                requires regular exercise and a balanced diet.</p>


            <h5>Tips to Get Lean Muscle Mass</h5>
            <p><b>Start with a Plan:</b> Create a workout plan that includes specific strength training exercises. This
                could be lifting weights, using resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises like squats and push-ups.
                Having a plan helps you stay focused and consistent.</p>

            <p><b>Increase Weight Gradually:</b> To build muscle, you need to challenge your muscles. Start with weights
                that are manageable and gradually increase them as you get stronger. This is called progressive
                overload, and it’s key to muscle growth.</p>
            <p><b>Eat Protein at every Meal:</b>Protein is crucial for muscle repair and growth. Try to include a good
                source of protein, like chicken, fish, eggs, beans, or tofu, in every meal. This helps your muscles
                recover and grow after workouts.</p>
            <p><b>Dont't Skip Carbs</b>Carbohydrates are important for providing energy, especially before workouts.
                Foods like rice, pasta, fruits, and vegetables can give you the energy you need to train hard and build
                muscle.</p>
            <p><b>Stay Consistent with workout:</b> Consistency is important for muscle growth. Stick to your workout
                routine and try not to miss any sessions. Over time, this regular effort will lead to noticeable gains
                in muscle mass.</p>
            <p><b>Get Enough Rest:</b>Muscles need time to recover and grow. Make sure you get plenty of sleep each
                night, and take rest days between intense workouts. This helps prevent injuries and supports muscle
                repair.</p>
            <p><b>Stay Hydrated:</b>Drinking plenty of water is essential for muscle function and recovery. Dehydration
                can make your workouts harder and slow down muscle growth. Aim to drink water throughout the day,
                especially before and after exercise.</p>
            <p><b>Track Your Progress</b> Keep a journal or use an app to track your workouts, diet, and how your
                muscles are changing. This helps you see what’s working and make adjustments to keep improving.</p>
